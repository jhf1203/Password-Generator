What do we need to know?

    - How many characters should the password be?

        - Do you want lower case letters?
        - Do you want upper case letters?
        - Do you want numbers?
        - Do you want symbols?

    REDIRECT IF:

    - character count is less than 8 or greater than 128
    - At least one of the above criteria isn't selected

    LISTS NEEDED (ARRAYS):

        - All lower case letters
        - All upper case letters
        - All numbers
        - All symbols

    POSSIBLE OUTCOMES (L-U-N-S):

        - Y-Y-Y-Y (Lower, upper, number, symbol)
        - Y-Y-Y-N (lower, upper, number)
        - Y-Y-N-Y (lower, upper, symbol)
        - Y-Y-N-N (lower, upper)
        - Y-N-Y-Y (lower, number, symbol)
        - Y-N-Y-N (lower, number)
        - Y-N-N-Y (lower, symbol)
        - Y-N-N-N (lower)
        - N-Y-Y-Y (upper, number, symbol)
        - N-Y-Y-N (upper, number)
        - N-Y-N-Y (upper, symbol)
        - N-Y-N-N (upper)
        - N-N-Y-Y (number, symbol)
        - N-N-Y-N (number)
        - N-N-N-Y (symbol)
